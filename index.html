          <p>In the AIR project hosted by Knowbility, I greatly contributed to both the design and development of Farmshare's website. My main tasks included creating the homepage and contact page, designing the header and footer for all pages, and ensuring responsiveness across devices. I resolved several accessibility issues using custom HTML and leveraged my knowledge of user experience design to improve the information architecture of the site. Additionally, I communicated with our NPO representative, Kathy, and our tech mentors, maintaining consistent updates and clarifying expectations about what our group could deliver within the project's timeframe. I also worked collaboratively with my group to ensure consistency and accessibility across all pages.</p>

      <h1>My Effects</h1>
        <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
          <p>One of my key strengths was my ability to adapt to WordPress while focusing on accessibility in the site development from the beginning. My coding experience and design knowledge allowed me to solve complex problems, like addressing issues with form labels, improving search bar functionality, and implementing responsive designs. I excelled at clear communication with the NPO client and mentors, ensuring alignment on project goals and expectations.</p>
          <p>One of my weaknesses was spending an extensive amount of time trying to perfect every aspect of the project, which sometimes delayed progress on other tasks. Additionally, I did not prioritize designing for mobile first, which led to challenges later in the process when ensuring the site was fully responsive across all devices. Recognizing these areas for improvement has helped me understand the importance of balancing perfectionism with efficiency and adopting a mobile-first approach from the start.</p>

          <p>This project highlighted the importance of balancing accessibility, user experience design, and requests from a client. I learned how crucial it is to maintain clear communication with clients about realistic outcomes. For future projects, I will prioritize designing for mobile first and establishing consistency in design elements from the outset. This will ensure smoother development and alignment across teams. Additionally, I will use insights from this project to integrate accessibility as a foundational element, applying strategies like user personas and usability testing to better address diverse user needs.</p>

      <h1>What Accessibility Can Do</h1>
       <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
          <p>Accessibility can eliminate barriers and foster inclusivity, enabling everyone to participate equally in society. By addressing attitudinal and environmental obstacles, accessibility ensures that designs meet fundamental human needs, such as independence, connection, and equal participation. Accessibility benefits not only individuals with disabilities but also a broader spectrum of users, including those experiencing temporary mismatches. It transforms exclusionary spaces into ones that embrace cultural expression. Ultimately, accessibility redefines what it means to design for everyone, emphasizing universal human experiences over merely functional solutions.</p>
